## Critical Issues - Complete List

### ‚úÖ Issue #1: Product Status Field Bug
**Priority:** HIGH
**Status:** FIXED
**Impact:** Export/Import operations were broken

**What Was Wrong:**
- Export used `$product->status` field (doesn't exist)
- Import expected `status` string but database has `is_active` boolean
- Filter logic was incorrect

**Solution:**
- Updated ProductsExport.php to use `is_active` field
- Updated ProductsImport.php to convert status strings to boolean
- Fixed filter to query `is_active` correctly

**Files Modified:**
- `/app/Exports/ProductsExport.php`
- `/app/Imports/ProductsImport.php`

**Result:** Import/Export now works correctly with existing database schema.

### ‚úÖ Issue #2: Users Show Page Missing
**Priority:** HIGH
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Impact:** No way to view individual user details

**What Was Wrong:**
- UsersController had `show()` method but no Vue page existed
- Clicking on users had nowhere to go

**Solution:**
- Created complete Users Show page
- User information display (name, email, role, additional roles)
- Organization information
- Account details (created date, verification status)
- Edit and delete actions with modal
- System role protection

**Files Created:**
- `/resources/js/Pages/Admin/Users/Show.vue` (165 lines)

**Result:** Full user viewing capability with professional UI.

---

### ‚úÖ Issue #3: Roles Show Page Missing
**Priority:** HIGH
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Impact:** No way to view role details and permissions

**What Was Wrong:**
- RolesController had `show()` method but no Vue page existed
- Couldn't see which permissions a role has
- Couldn't see which users have a role

**Solution:**
- Created complete Roles Show page
- Role information (name, description, type)
- Grouped permissions display by category
- List of users with this role
- Edit/delete actions (disabled for system roles)
- System role protection notice

**Files Created:**
- `/resources/js/Pages/Admin/Roles/Show.vue` (178 lines)

**Result:** Full role management visibility with security controls.

---

### ‚úÖ Issue #4: Stock Adjustment System Missing
**Priority:** HIGH
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Impact:** Core inventory feature completely absent

**What Was Wrong:**
- No way to manually adjust stock levels
- No history of stock changes
- No audit trail for inventory modifications
- Had to directly edit database for adjustments

**Solution:**
Built complete Stock Adjustment system:

1. **Controller** (`StockAdjustmentController.php`)
   - index() - List all adjustments with filtering
   - create() - Show create form
   - store() - Process and save adjustment
   - show() - Display adjustment details

2. **Index Page** (`Index.vue`)
   - Advanced filtering (search, type, product, user, date range)
   - Color-coded table display
   - Type badges
   - Pagination

3. **Create Page** (`Create.vue`)
   - Product selection dropdown with stock display
   - Live 3-column preview (Before/Change/After)
   - Real-time stock calculator
   - Adjustment types (manual, recount, damage, loss, return, correction)
   - Smart validation
   - Negative stock warning

4. **Show Page** (`Show.vue`)
   - Summary cards (Before/Change/After)
   - Visual timeline with 3 steps
   - Complete adjustment information
   - Color-coded based on increase/decrease

**Files Created:**
- `/app/Http/Controllers/Inventory/StockAdjustmentController.php` (150 lines)
- `/resources/js/Pages/StockAdjustments/Index.vue` (240 lines)
- `/resources/js/Pages/StockAdjustments/Create.vue` (200 lines)
- `/resources/js/Pages/StockAdjustments/Show.vue` (210 lines)

**Files Modified:**
- `/routes/web.php` (added 4 routes)

**Total Code:** ~800 lines

**Result:** Full stock management system with audit trail and filtering.

**Documentation:** See `STOCK_ADJUSTMENT_COMPLETE.md` for details.

### ‚úÖ Issue #5: Order Items Cannot Be Edited
**Priority:** HIGH
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Impact:** Orders locked after creation, major limitation

**What Was Wrong:**
- OrderController@update only handled order metadata
- Items were completely locked after creation
- No way to add/remove/modify items
- Had to cancel and recreate entire orders

**Solution:**

1. **Backend** (OrderController@update)
   - Added validation for items array
   - Implemented sophisticated item comparison logic
   - Stock reconciliation based on quantity changes
   - Proper handling of added, updated, and removed items
   - Recalculation of order totals

2. **Frontend** (Orders/Edit.vue)
   - Added items to form data
   - Updated subtotal to calculate from items
   - Created item management functions (add/remove/update)
   - Replaced read-only display with editable grid
   - Product dropdown with stock display
   - Live subtotal calculations
   - Validation error display

**Key Logic:**
- Compare existing items with submitted items
- Update existing items with stock adjustment by difference
- Add new items and reduce stock
- Remove deleted items and restore stock
- Recalculate all order totals

**Files Modified:**
- `/app/Http/Controllers/Order/OrderController.php` (lines 181-293)
- `/resources/js/Pages/Orders/Edit.vue` (complete overhaul)

**Total Code:** ~250 lines modified/added

**Result:** Full order editing capability with proper stock reconciliation.

**Documentation:** See `ORDER_ITEMS_EDITING_COMPLETE.md` for details.
