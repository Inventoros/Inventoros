 * Hello World Plugin for InventorOS

 * This plugin does absolutely nothing useful and that's perfectly okay!
 * It's here to show you how plugins work and give you something to delete
 * when you're feeling productive. Go ahead, we won't judge. üòä
 *
 * Seriously though, this demonstrates:
 * - How to use hooks and filters
 * - How to log plugin activity
 * - How plugins integrate with InventorOS
 *
 * Delete me whenever you want! I'm just here for moral support.

// Example: Track dashboard views
