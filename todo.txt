‚úÖ Fully Complete (Backend + UI):

  1. CSV Import/Export - Full UI with filters, drag-drop
  2. Barcode Display - Shows on product details page with print
  3. SKU Generation - Beautiful modal with presets and patterns
  4. Dashboard Analytics - Enhanced with activity feed, charts
  5. Product CRUD - Complete with all fields

  ‚ö†Ô∏è Backend Complete, UI Needed:

  1. Activity Log Viewer - Controller created, needs Vue page
  2. Stock Adjustment UI - Model/service ready, needs form
  3. Product Image Uploader - DB ready, needs upload component
  4. Bulk Barcode Printing - Service ready, needs batch UI
  5. Activity Timeline - On product details (show history)
  6. Stock Movement Charts - Data ready, needs chart component

  üéØ What I Recommend Adding First:

  1. Activity Log viewer page (already started the controller)
  2. Stock adjustment quick-add form on product page
  3. Image uploader component for products

  The system is incredibly feature-rich! Would you like me to:
  A) Continue building the Activity Log Vue page
  B) Focus on Stock Adjustments UI
  C) Add the image uploader
  D) Create a summary document of all features?
