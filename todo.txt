═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🔴 HIGH PRIORITY - CRITICAL GAPS (Must Fix First)

  1. Users Show Page - MISSING
     Backend: ✅ UserController@show exists
     Frontend: ❌ /resources/js/Pages/Admin/Users/Show.vue
     Impact: Links in Users Index lead nowhere

  2. Roles Show Page - MISSING
     Backend: ✅ RoleController@show exists with permission details
     Frontend: ❌ /resources/js/Pages/Admin/Roles/Show.vue
     Impact: Cannot view role details

  3. Stock Adjustment System - COMPLETELY MISSING
     Model: ✅ Complete with relationships
     Database: ✅ Table with all fields
     Controller: ❌ Missing
     Routes: ❌ Not defined
     UI: ❌ Need Index, Create, Show pages
     Impact: CRITICAL - Can't manually adjust stock or view history

  4. Order Items Cannot Be Edited
     Location: OrderController@update (line 181-210)
     Issue: Only updates metadata, not line items
     Impact: Major limitation - items locked after creation

  5. Product Status Field Bug - WILL CAUSE ERRORS
     Issue: Import/Export use "status" but DB uses "is_active"
     Files: ProductsExport.php:94, ProductsImport.php:98
     Impact: Import/Export will fail

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY - IMPORTANT FEATURES

  6. Activity Log Viewer Page
     Backend: ✅ ActivityLogController complete
     Frontend: ❌ /resources/js/Pages/Admin/ActivityLog/Index.vue
     Impact: Can't view system activity logs

  7. Reports & Analytics System - NOT IMPLEMENTED
     Permission: EXISTS (VIEW_REPORTS)
     Implementation: ❌ Complete module missing
     Needed:
       - Inventory valuation report
       - Stock movement report
       - Product performance report
       - Revenue/sales analysis
       - Category & location analysis
     Impact: No business intelligence features

  8. Order Approval Workflow
     Permission: ✅ APPROVE_ORDERS exists
     Implementation: ❌ No approval logic in controller
     Impact: Permission exists but does nothing

  9. Notification System - INCOMPLETE
     Backend: Partial (updateNotifications exists)
     Database: ❌ No notifications table
     Sending: ❌ No email/notification logic
     Impact: No low stock alerts, no order notifications

  10. Organization Address Fields - DATABASE MISMATCH
      Controller: Validates city, state, zip, country, timezone
      Database: Only has basic "address" field
      Fix: Need migration to add missing columns

  11. Barcode Printing UI - BACKEND READY BUT HIDDEN
      Backend: ✅ Routes & controller complete
      Template: ✅ Blade template exists
      UI: ❌ No buttons in Product pages
      Impact: Feature exists but inaccessible to users

  12. Purchase Order System - COMPLETELY MISSING
      Database: Only purchase_price field exists
      Models: ❌ No Supplier/Vendor models
      Impact: Can't track suppliers or create POs

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🟢 LOW PRIORITY - POLISH & CLEANUP

  13. SKU Generator UI Integration
      Backend: ✅ Complete (service, routes ready)
      UI: ❌ Not in Product Create/Edit forms

  14. Product Activity History Timeline
      Backend: ✅ LogsActivity trait active
      UI: ❌ Not shown on Product Show page

  15. Bulk Barcode Printing
      Service: Ready
      UI: Need batch selection interface

  16. Empty Controllers Cleanup
      Files: ImportController.php, ExportController.php
      Action: DELETE (empty duplicates)

  17. API Endpoints
      File: routes/api.php doesn't exist
      Impact: No REST API for external integrations
