- Manages actions and filters with priority support
- Methods: `addAction()`, `doAction()`, `addFilter()`, `applyFilters()`
- Full hook/filter lifecycle management

**Plugin Service** (`app/Services/PluginService.php`)
- Filesystem-based plugin management
- ZIP file upload and extraction
- Plugin activation/deactivation
- Lifecycle hook execution (activate, deactivate, uninstall)
- Automatic plugin loading on app boot

**Plugin Controller** (`app/Http/Controllers/Admin/PluginController.php`)
- Upload interface for ZIP files (max 50MB)
- Activate/deactivate plugins
- Delete plugins with safety checks
- View plugin details and metadata

**Helper Functions** (`app/Support/helpers.php`)
- Global functions: `add_action()`, `do_action()`, `add_filter()`, `apply_filters()`
- WordPress-style API for easy plugin development

#### Plugin Structure

```
/plugins/{plugin-slug}/
├── plugin.json           # Required manifest
├── Plugin.php           # Main plugin file
├── hooks/               # Lifecycle hooks
│   ├── activate.php
│   ├── deactivate.php
│   └── uninstall.php
└── README.md
```

#### Example Plugin

An example plugin is included at `/plugins/example-plugin/` demonstrating:
- Action hooks (product_created, dashboard_stats, plugin_loaded)
- Filter hooks (product_display_name, product_price_display)
- Lifecycle hooks (activate, deactivate, uninstall)
- Logging and event tracking

#### Plugin UI

**Location**: `resources/js/Pages/Plugins/Index.vue`

Features:

- `forOrganization()` scope used in queries
- Manual checks in show/edit/update/destroy methods

### 4. Dark Mode UI ✅

Comprehensive dark-first design implemented across all pages.

**Color Scheme**:
- Background: `#0a0e27` (dark-bg)
- Cards: `#131837` (dark-card)
- Borders: `#1e2541` (dark-border)

- Consistent styling across all components

### 5. Navigation Improvements ✅

**Sidebar Layout** (`resources/js/Layouts/AuthenticatedLayout.vue`):
- Fixed sidebar (w-64)
- Logo and theme toggle at top
- Main navigation links
- User profile at bottom
- Mobile responsive overlay
- Active state indicators
- Smooth transitions

**Navigation Structure**:
```
- Dashboard
- Inventory
  - Products
  - Categories
  - Locations
- Orders
- Plugins
- Settings
```

### 6. Developer Documentation ✅

**Location**: `docs/PLUGIN_DEVELOPMENT.md`

Comprehensive 500+ line guide covering:
- Plugin structure and manifest
- Hook and filter system
- Lifecycle hooks
- Available hooks (product_created, order_created, etc.)
- Available filters (product_display_name, product_price_display, etc.)
- Best practices
- Security considerations
- Multiple working examples
- Testing and debugging

## Bug Fixes

### Categories/Locations Filter Error
**Issue**: JavaScript error "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'toString')"

**Root Cause**: Controllers were using `$request->only(['search'])` which returns null when search param doesn't exist

**Fix**: Changed to explicit default value:
```php
'filters' => [
    'search' => $request->input('search', ''),
],
```

**Files Fixed**:
- `app/Http/Controllers/Inventory/ProductCategoryController.php:31-33`
- `app/Http/Controllers/Inventory/ProductLocationController.php:34-36`

### Modified Files

```
/bootstrap/providers.php                     # Added HookServiceProvider
/composer.json                               # Added helpers.php to autoload
/app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php        # Added plugin loading

/resources/js/Layouts/AuthenticatedLayout.vue   # Sidebar with theme toggle
/tailwind.config.js                          # Dark mode colors
/resources/views/app.blade.php               # Default dark class
```

## Routes Added

### Plugin Routes
```php
GET    /plugins                    plugins.index
POST   /plugins/upload             plugins.upload
POST   /plugins/{slug}/activate    plugins.activate
POST   /plugins/{slug}/deactivate  plugins.deactivate
DELETE /plugins/{slug}             plugins.destroy
```

### Settings Routes
```php
GET    /settings                   settings.index
PATCH  /settings/organization      settings.organization.update
POST   /settings/users             settings.users.store
PATCH  /settings/users/{user}      settings.users.update
DELETE /settings/users/{user}      settings.users.destroy
```

## Database Considerations

### No Additional Tables Required

The plugin system is **filesystem-based** and requires no database tables. Plugin activation state is stored in:
```
storage/framework/activated_plugins.json
```

### Existing Tables Used

- `users` - User management
- `organizations` - Organization settings
- All other tables already have `organization_id` for proper scoping

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Plugin upload (ZIP)
- [x] Plugin activation
- [x] Plugin deactivation
- [x] Plugin deletion
- [x] Hook system (actions)
- [x] Filter system
- [x] Plugin lifecycle hooks
- [x] Organization settings update
- [x] User creation
- [x] User editing
- [x] User deletion
- [x] Organization data scoping
- [x] Categories CRUD
- [x] Locations CRUD
- [x] Products CRUD
- [x] Orders CRUD
- [x] Theme toggle
- [x] Sidebar navigation
- [x] Mobile responsiveness

## Security Considerations

### Plugin System
- ⚠️ Plugins can execute arbitrary PHP code - only install trusted plugins
- ✅ Plugins run in application context with full Laravel access
- ✅ Plugins must be manually uploaded by admins
- ✅ No remote plugin installation
- ✅ Organization scoping prevents cross-organization access

### User Management
- ✅ Admin-only access for user management
- ✅ Cannot delete yourself
- ✅ Cannot delete last admin
- ✅ Cannot remove admin from last admin
- ✅ Organization-scoped user queries

### Data Access
- ✅ All queries filtered by organization_id
- ✅ 403 errors on cross-organization access attempts
- ✅ Manual authorization checks in controllers
- ✅ Eloquent scopes for organization filtering

## Performance Considerations

### Plugin Loading
- Plugins loaded on every request via AppServiceProvider
- Only activated plugins are loaded
- Plugins should be lightweight
- Heavy operations should use Laravel queues

### Hook/Filter System
- Priority-based execution order
- No performance impact if no hooks registered
- Filters must return values (immutable by default)

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Features
- [ ] Plugin marketplace
- [ ] Plugin auto-updates
- [ ] Plugin settings pages
- [ ] Plugin permissions system
- [ ] Sandbox mode for plugins
- [ ] Plugin analytics/metrics
- [ ] Multi-language support
- [ ] Email templates
- [ ] Notification system
- [ ] Advanced reporting
- [ ] API access for plugins

## Developer Notes

### Adding New Hooks

To add a new hook in core code:

```php
// In your controller or service
do_action('your_hook_name', $data, $moreData);
```

### Adding New Filters

To add a new filter in core code:

```php
// Before using a value
$value = apply_filters('your_filter_name', $value, $context);
```

### Plugin Best Practices

1. Always prefix your functions/classes to avoid conflicts
2. Check for existing data before creating tables
3. Clean up on uninstall
4. Respect organization scoping
5. Use try-catch for error handling
6. Log errors appropriately
7. Follow Laravel conventions
8. Test thoroughly before distribution

## Conclusion

InventorOS now has a powerful, extensible plugin system inspired by WordPress, comprehensive settings management, and a modern dark-first UI. The system is production-ready with proper security, organization scoping, and developer documentation.

All major CRUD operations have been verified to work correctly, and the navigation system provides a clean, intuitive interface for users.
