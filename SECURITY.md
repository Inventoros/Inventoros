# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Inventoros is currently in early development. Security updates will be applied to the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| main    | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

**Note**: Until version 1.0 is released, only the `main` branch receives security updates. We recommend always running the latest version from the main branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Inventoros team takes security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by:

1. **Email**: Send an email to **[security@inventoros.com]** with:
   - A description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce or proof of concept
   - Potential impact of the vulnerability
   - Any suggested fixes (if applicable)

2. **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature:
   - Go to the [Security Advisories page](https://github.com/inventoros/inventoros/security/advisories)
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Fill out the form with details

### What to Include in Your Report

To help us better understand and address the issue, please include:

- **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, authentication bypass)
- **Full paths of source file(s)** related to the vulnerability
- **Location of the affected source code** (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- **Impact of the vulnerability** - what could an attacker achieve?
- **Any special configuration** required to reproduce the issue
- **Your environment details** (PHP version, database, OS, etc.)

### Response Timeline

We will make our best effort to respond according to the following timeline:

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of report submission
- **Confirmation**: Within 1 week, we will confirm the vulnerability and its severity
- **Resolution**: We will work on a fix and coordinate disclosure timing with you
- **Disclosure**: After a fix is released, we will publicly disclose the vulnerability

### What to Expect

After you submit a report:

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report
2. **Assessment**: Our team will investigate and validate the vulnerability
3. **Updates**: We'll keep you informed about our progress
4. **Fix Development**: We'll develop and test a fix
5. **Coordinated Disclosure**: We'll coordinate with you on the disclosure timeline
6. **Public Disclosure**: After the fix is deployed, we'll publish a security advisory
7. **Credit**: We'll credit you in the security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

### Security Vulnerability Response Process

1. **Triage**: Assess severity using CVSS scoring
2. **Confirmation**: Verify the vulnerability in our environment
3. **Development**: Create a patch or mitigation
4. **Testing**: Verify the fix doesn't introduce regressions
5. **Release**: Deploy the fix to the main branch
6. **Notification**: Notify users via GitHub Security Advisories and release notes
7. **Documentation**: Update security documentation as needed

## Security Best Practices for Users

When deploying Inventoros, follow these security best practices:

### Environment Configuration

- **Never commit `.env` files** to version control
- **Use strong, unique passwords** for database and admin accounts
- **Enable HTTPS** in production environments
- **Keep `APP_DEBUG` set to `false`** in production
- **Set a secure `APP_KEY`** using `php artisan key:generate`
- **Use environment-specific `.env` files** (never share between environments)

### Dependencies

- **Keep dependencies updated**: Run `composer update` and `npm update` regularly
- **Monitor security advisories**: Watch for Laravel and package security updates
- **Review dependency licenses**: Ensure compatibility with your use case

### Access Control

- **Use strong authentication**: Implement multi-factor authentication when possible
- **Follow principle of least privilege**: Grant minimal necessary permissions
- **Rotate API tokens regularly**: Especially for production systems
- **Review user permissions**: Audit access controls periodically

### Database Security

- **Use separate database users** with minimal required privileges
- **Enable SSL/TLS** for database connections in production
- **Regularly backup data** and test restoration procedures
- **Sanitize database dumps** before sharing (remove sensitive data)

### Server Security

- **Keep PHP and system packages updated**
- **Disable unnecessary PHP extensions**
- **Configure proper file permissions** (storage and bootstrap/cache directories)
- **Use a WAF (Web Application Firewall)** in production
- **Monitor logs** for suspicious activity

### Application Security

- **Validate all user input** (Inventoros uses Laravel's validation, but verify custom code)
- **Use parameterized queries** (Laravel's Eloquent handles this, avoid raw queries)
- **Implement rate limiting** for API endpoints
- **Enable CSRF protection** (enabled by default in Laravel)
- **Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers**

## Known Security Considerations

### Development Phase Warnings

As Inventoros is in active development:

- **API endpoints may change** without notice
- **Authentication mechanisms** are still being finalized
- **Multi-tenant isolation** is under development and not production-ready
- **Audit logging** is not yet fully implemented

### Production Deployment

**We do not recommend using Inventoros in production until version 1.0 is released.**

If you choose to deploy in production:

- Understand that you assume all associated risks
- Implement additional security layers (WAF, monitoring, backups)
- Regularly check for updates and apply them promptly
- Have a rollback plan in case of issues

## Security Updates and Advisories

Security updates will be announced through:

- **GitHub Security Advisories**: https://github.com/inventoros/inventoros/security/advisories
- **Release Notes**: Tagged releases with security patches
- **GitHub Discussions**: Security announcements category
- **Email Notifications**: For critical vulnerabilities (if you've reported issues previously)

Subscribe to repository notifications to stay informed about security updates.
